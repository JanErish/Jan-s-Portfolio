### 1. Supervised Learning + [COMING SOON] Data Preprocessing and Extreme Gradient Bossting Model Training Pipeline
https://github.com/JanErish/Portfolio_von_Jan/blob/master/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Prediction%20%5BJan%20Erish%20Baluca%20%5D%2029-10-2017.ipynb

#### Extreme Gradient Bossting Pipeline Preview:
This section will serve to demonstrate the following skills:
1. Object Oriented Programming: Building complex classes and functions
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data pipeline (scikit-learn) building
4. Model tuning and cross-validation
5. XGBoost model creation

The end product will be a class or module for easily training XGBoost supervised machine learning models that:
* automatically preprocesses data
    * dealing with missing values
    * encoding categorical variables
    * resampling the dataset to deal with class imbalance and skewdness
    * normalizing features
    * reducing dimensionality
    * selecting important features
* automatically finds the best setting for a model to deal with a specific dataset through hyperparameter tuning
* automatically trains the model using the best parameters found
* automatically evaluates model performance through cross-validation

The advantages of using the class are:
* The end user will not have to backtrack through the source code to change very specific settings.
* The end user will not have to copy paste hundreds of lines of code everytime a model has to be trained.
* Preprocessing and training settings are all packed in each instance and are easy to access and modify.
* The end user will be able to calibrate the same specific configurations for all instances of the XGBoost_trainer with possibly one line, eliminating the need to calibate each one by one.
* The trainer is built from the ground up with expert knowledge: best-practices and conventions in the industry.
